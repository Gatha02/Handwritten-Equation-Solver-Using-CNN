Creating a Handwritten Equation Solver using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is an exciting project that involves combining computer vision and mathematical logic. Here's an overview of how this project could 
be structured:

Overview
The project involves developing a machine learning model to recognize handwritten mathematical symbols and numbers, solve the equation, and display the results using an interactive interface like Streamlit. The 
core task is split into three components: data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. The CNN is trained on a dataset of handwritten mathematical symbols, such as digits (0â€“9) and operators (+, -, *, /, =). 
Common datasets like the MNIST dataset for digits and custom datasets for operators can be used. The preprocessing step includes resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and one-hot encoding the labels.

The CNN is designed to classify each character accurately. Once trained, the model can recognize symbols from images captured through a drawing pad or uploaded files. The recognized symbols are then parsed into a 
mathematical equation, which can be solved programmatically using Python libraries like sympy.

Deployment
The solution is deployed using Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface. Users can draw equations on a canvas, and the app processes the input, identifies the characters using the trained CNN, and solves the 
equation in real time. PyCharm is used as the development environment to write and debug the Python code. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning, image processing, and web app deployment, 
making it an excellent example of practical AI applications.
